# H1 Welcome to All of Creation

There are many stories and versions of how Creation came to be, and who governs it, and all the various questions people have about the world. There are dozens of belief systems and hundreds of various types of calendars, but the most popular current timekeeping methodology is what's known as the Common People's Calendar, also known as the Sidereal Calendar.

# H2 The Poles

All Creation lies in the immense volume between the six Elemental Poles: Metal, Fire, Stone, Water, Wood, and Air. Each pole has aspects and associations, including things like direction and attribute. 

1. Metal
 * Primidi, the first day of the week
 * the Strength attribute
 * the South Pole
 * known as The Infinite Glacier
2. Fire
 * Duodi, the second day of the week
 * the Dexterity attribute
 * the North Pole
 * known as The Great Desert
3. Stone
 * Tridi, the third day of the week
 * the Constitution attribute
 * the Down Pole
 * known as The Foundation
4. Water
 * Quartidi, the fourth day of the week
 * the Intelligence attribute
 * The East Pole
 * known as The World Ocean
5. Wood
 * Quintidi, the fifth day of the week
 * the Wisdom attribute
 * The West Pole
* known as The Lifespring
6. Air
* sextidi, the sixth day of the week and the traditional day of rest
* the Charisma attribute
* The Up Pole
* known as The Celestial Mechanism

# H3 The Arcana Obscura

In addition, there is an Occult force sometimes known as the Seventh Pole; it does not have an associated direction and is associated with the arcane, the magical, the secret, and the hidden. It is the last (31st) day of every month of the year. It is the only day in the calendar where there are no moons in the sky.

# H2 The Celestial Mechanism of Time

The Great Celestial Mechanism is the machinery that keeps Creation together and working. Far up in towards the Air Pole, the visible skies display signs, indicators, and portents, as well as the vast and invisible trails of the Celestial Bodies. The entirety of time, including passage and division, is directed by and reflected in the Celestial Mechanism, measured against the movements of stars, planets, moons, and other bodies. The basis of time is therefore sidereal. 

# H3 The Sidereal Year

* A year 372 days, divided into 4 seasons of 3 months of 31 days each
* A Year ends on Midwinter, the shortest day of the year (which is the 31st day of the 12th month) and begins on the day after (the 1st day of the 1st Month)
* The movement of the sun slows down for six months (from 1 Nivose until 31 Prarial), which causes the days to become warmer and longer; then the sun speeds up for six months (from 1 Messidor until 31 Frimaire) which causes the days to become colder and shorter
* Each Season is made up of 3 31-day months grouped broadly by the agricultural activity occuring during those months
* Each month is divided into 5 weeks of 5 work days plus one rest day each, plus a Hidden Day on the 31st day which is considered a rest day (or, at least, a non-work day) 

# H3 The Sidereal Day

While there are efforts to more finely divide the time of day, current mechanical expertise does not exist (or at least is quite rare). For common usage, the day is divided into 8
